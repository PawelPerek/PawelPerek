# Hi, I'm Paweł Perek! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a software engineer who started my career as a front-end developer, focusing primarily on React. However, my passion for programming has led me to explore and appreciate various programming paradigms and languages throughout my academic journey. 

# About Me 📚

 - 🎓 Currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at AGH
 - 💼 Former front-end developer with 4 years of experience working with React
 - 🌱 Always eager to learn new technologies and programming languages.
 - 🎯 Passionate about creating efficient, clean, and maintainable code
 - 💻 Setup: VS Code, currently learning Helix

# Technical skills 🔧
As I previously mentioned, I really like programming and went through a lot of programming languages, so it's hard for me to mention all languages I've ever wrote in without it looking as a clickbait for SEO. Instead of that I decided to distill four areas which I enjoy the most.

### Low-Level programming 🛠️
I'm a person that needs to understand something before starts working with it, so naturally when I started programming I was curious to look into internals of how computers work. With time it started to be my favourite area, because I really like to have explicit control over software and be able to look into details with compiler explorer (using excellent https://godbolt.org/). Besides programming software I also designed hardware using VHDL and SystemVerilog, but I have noticeably less experience with it, so I decided not to put it on the list below.

- Languages 
  - Rust: My favourite programming language. I love the expressiveness, safety and cross-platform capabilities it provides.
  - C++: I like modern versions of it (C++17/20), mostly because of smart pointers they provide.
  - C: It was my first langauge so I have warm feelings towards it, but I'm aware that I need be extra cautious when programming in it not to cause any memory leaks.
- Assebmbly languages:
  - RISC-V - my favourite assembly language, I love everything about it: simplicity, modular design, clean syntax and amazing vector extension. It might not have as much market share as ARM and x86, but I hope it will gain traction in the nearest future. I plan on contributing to RISC-V infrastructure during my masters degree.
  - ARM: I consider it objectively the best architecture, although a bit too complicated for my liking (but still miles ahead of x86 in my ranking).
  - x86: I don't like x86 ASM all that much, but living in x86-centric world pushes me to at least know it.
  - WASM: I know it only as a compilation target, haven't have time to look into WAT yet.
 
### Webdev 🌐
By webdev I mean front-end, back-end and mobile apps (I consider modern mobile app development with declarative frameworks such as SwiftUI and Flutter to be too close to front-end development with React to split those terms into different areas). I believe that this area is much easier and more straightforward than previous one, so I will not explain it with detail.

- Technologies
  - Front-end: Preact, Solid, Rust/Leptos
  - Back-end: Rust/Axum, Node.js, Haskell
  - Mobile: Flutter, SwiftUI, want to learn Jetpack Compose
  - DB: PostgreSQL, MongoDB

### AI 🧠

I know the basics of feed-forward, convolutional, and recurrent neural networks, and can train and deploy them. In the future, I would like to explore more DL architectures such as Differentiable Neural Computer, but I don't think I will have time to do this anytime soon. 

- Technologies: mostly Tensorflow, but also basics of Julia/Flux

# Non-skills 🗙

At this point I would like to list all the programming areas I'm not fluent in but seem like fun so I will probably explore them in the future.

### GPU programming 🎮

I know the basics of GPU pipeline, fragment, vertex and compute shaders, but never put my knowledge to use because of how the hard setup seemed. With that said, I have high hopes for SYCL (https://www.khronos.org/sycl/), beacuse it seems like a great step in GPU compute programming simplification. When the ecosystem will mature I will probably come back to explore the possibilities it provides. 

### Quantum progamming ⚛️

I implemented a few basic algorithms using Silq (https://silq.ethz.ch/), but I never truly understood the constraints quantum programming imposes on programmer (for example why all quantum operations need to be reversible). I will come back to this topic and try to wrap my head around the concepts once again.
